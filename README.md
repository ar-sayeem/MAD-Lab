### *Mobile Application Design & Lab Repository*  

Welcome to my **MAD-Lab** repository! This repository contains my **weekly progress** and learning materials from the **Mobile Application Design & Lab** course.  

## ðŸš€ **What am I doing here?**  
I am currently learning **Dart basics** as a foundational step toward **Flutter app development**. This repository will be regularly updated with new concepts, code snippets, and lab tasks that I complete throughout the course.
